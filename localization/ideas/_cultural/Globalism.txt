Globalism:

They emphasize the need to transcend
nationalism and work together to dismantle
the structures that perpetuate wealth
concentration, exploitation, and
social disparities.

Advocates of globalism believe that the

across the world, leading to exploitation of
the Global South by the Global North.

At its core, it seeks to address global
economic inequalities by advocating for
the collective ownership and control of
resources, means of production, and wealth
distribution on a global scale.
