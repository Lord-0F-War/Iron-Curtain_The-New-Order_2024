Multiculturalism:

Multiculturalism advocates for addressing both
economic inequality and cultural discrimination
as interconnected issues.

It emphasizes the need to dismantle not only
class-based disparities but also the structures
that perpetuate cultural hierarchies.

By doing so, proponents of this perspective believe
that a truly equitable society can be achieved, where
all individuals have the opportunity to develop their
potential regardless of their cultural background.
