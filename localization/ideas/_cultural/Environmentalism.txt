Environmentalism:            

Rooted in the idea that capitalism exacerbates
environmental degradation, this perspective
argues that the pursuit of profit leads to
overconsumption, resource depletion, and
disregard for the planet's well-being.

Environmentalism highlights how the system's
relentless drive for growth can lead to
exploitation of both labor and nature.

It contends that addressing environmental
issues requires tackling the underlying economic
structure that prioritizes profit over sustainability.

By transcending the capitalist framework, proponents
believe we can forge a more harmonious relationship
between humanity and nature, emphasizing long-term
ecological stability over short-term gains.
