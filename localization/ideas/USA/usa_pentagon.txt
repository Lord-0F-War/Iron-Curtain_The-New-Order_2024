Pentagon:

The Pentagon is the headquarters building  of  the
United States Department of Defense.              

During the late 1960s, the Pentagon became a focal 
point for protests against the Vietnam War.       
 
In  one  of   the   better  known  incidents,  on 
21 October 1967, some 35,000  anti-war protesters 
organized by the National  Mobilization Committee 
to  End  the  War  in  Vietnam,  gathered  for  a 
demonstration   at   the    Defense    Department,
the "March on the Pentagon".                   

They were confronted by some 2,500 armed soldiers. 
During the protest, a  famous  picture  was taken, 
where George  Harris  placed carnations into  the 
soldiers' gun barrels.                           

The march concluded with an attempt to "exorcise" 
the building.
