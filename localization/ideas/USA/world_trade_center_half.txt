World Trade Center Half Done:            

Construction work began on the North Tower in
August 1968, and construction  on  the  South 
Tower  was  under way by January 1969.  

The   topping   out   ceremony    of   1  WTC 
(North Tower) took place on December 23, 1970,
while  2 WTC's ceremony (South Tower) occurred
on July 19, 1971.

Extensive  use   of  prefabricated  components 
helped  to speed up the construction  process,
and  the first tenants moved  into  the  North
Tower  in   December 15, 1970,  while  it  was  
still  under  construction,  while  the  South  
Tower began accepting  tenants in January 1972.
