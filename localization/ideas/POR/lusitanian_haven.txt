Lusitanian Haven:
		
The honorary president of the Jewish community 
of Lisbon, claimed in 1937 that "happily in 
Portugal, modern anti-Semitism doesn't exist".

Modern anti-Semitism failed "to establish even 
a toehold in Portugal", while it grew virulently
elsewhere in early 20th-century Europe.

The number of refugees who escaped through 
Portugal during the war has been estimated to 
range from a few hundred thousand to one million, 
large numbers considering the size of the country's
population of about 6 million at that time.

After the war, Portugal kept on welcoming and 
supporting refugees.

Among the many refugees accepted into Portugal for
political and religious asylum, Miklos Horthy, the 
war-time leader of Hungary.
