Cost of the Arms Race:
		
The arms race during the  Cold  War  imposed a
staggering financial burden on the Soviet Union.

As the rivalry between the USSR and the United
States escalated, both nations  engaged  in  a
costly competition to  develop  and  stockpile
increasingly sophisticated and powerful weapons.

The USSR's pursuit of  nuclear  weapons, space
exploration, and military technologies strained
its economy and resources to the brink.

The Soviet government allocated  a  substantial
portion of its budget to the military-industrial
complex, which led to the neglect  of  societal
needs and contributed to economic stagnation.

Ultimately, the arms race's financial toll 
is playing a significant role in exacerbating
the systemic weaknesses of the Soviet economy
and contributed to its eventual collapse.
