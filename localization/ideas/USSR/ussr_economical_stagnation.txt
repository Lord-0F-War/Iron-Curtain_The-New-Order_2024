Economical Stagnation:
		
Under the leadership of  Leonid  Brezhnev,  the
Soviet economy faces  numerous  challenges that
hinders its growth and efficiency.

The economy's heavy reliance  on  a centralized
planning system and state ownership of industries
led to inefficiencies, lack of  innovation, and
poor allocation of resources.

Bureaucratic   bottlenecks   and   a   top-down
decision-making process stifled initiatives and
discourages innovation, hindering economic growth.

The cumbersome administrative processes made it
difficult for businesses to function smoothly,
while corruption further eroded trust in the system.

The Brezhnev period  also  saw  a  decrease  in
productivity growth and a lack of incentives for
workers  to  perform  at  their  best,  as  the
state-controlled   economy   offered   limited
opportunities for individual advancement or
recognition.

The agricultural sector, in particular, struggled
to keep  pace  with  the  demands  of  a  growing
population.

The collective farming system implemented led to
inefficiencies, low yields, and chronic food
shortages.

The USSR, once an exporter of grain, became reliant
on importing grain to meet its citizens' basic needs.

And consumer goods were often of poor quality and in
short supply, leading to long wait times for products
as basic as cars and appliances.
